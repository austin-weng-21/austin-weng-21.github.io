                    <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
                    <p> Neuroplasticity, or the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior, can
                        help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being–no matter
                        our age.</p>
                    <h5>Neuroplasticity helps people learning</h5>
                    <p>A growing body of research supports the role that neuroplasticity plays in learning. The ability
                        of the brain to reconfigure makes the acquirement of new information and new skills possible.
                        The brain must be impacted by this new information in order to learn it: the nature of learning
                        is that we change through experience.</p>
                    <h5>Neuroplasticity helps people recovering from stroke</h5>
                    <p>Research has shown that the brain is entirely capable of responding dynamically to situations
                        that allow it to make changes to its neural circuits. This is essential in recovery from brain
                        injury, such as stroke. Studies have shown that neuroplasticity, in part, is responsible for
                        successful recovery in those rehabilitating from a stroke.</p>
                    <h5>Neuroplasticity and cognitive behavior therapy</h5>
                    <p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be at least as effective as medication in
                        treating depression. It is also considered highly effective in treating anxiety disorders.</p>
                    <p>I may use the following ways to increase my own neuroplasticity.</p>
                    <ul class="post-section-list">
                        <li> Playing videos games as I do enjoy looking at the whole game as a big picture and figuring
                            out a strategy, deploying tactics and to win. </li>
                        <li> Learning a new language which I have been doing now, learning English.</li>
                        <li> Learn a music instrument. I have been thinking about learning to play piano. I will find
                            some time after this course to pick up this new skill.</li>
                        <li>I like traveling too as this broaden my horizon and enrich my life.</li>
                        <li>I like walking and hiking as this clears my mind and sometimes good ideas pop in.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is the walking and hiking website link as I believe this is very beneficial.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/nz/walking-and-hiking/?cid=p:sem:NZ:0721:inspire:always-on:google:kwd&kwid=kwd-356794582035&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw6vq3_fZ8QIV8JFmAh3K5wQJEAAYASAAEgLBtfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">
                        WALKING AND HIKING</a>
                    <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
                    <p> A growth mindset is when people understand that their abilities can be developed and understand
                        that effort makes them stronger. Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to
                        higher achievement.</p>
                    <p>After listening to Dr. Dweck’s research it surprises me with the achievements that average people
                        can get, some of them achieved high at even very disadvantageous position. This shows you how
                        powerful a growth mindset is and how it can help a person to reach the long-term goals. I will
                        definitely take advantage of this growth mindset power to help me through this learning journey.
                        I will keep telling myself that I can do it. </p>
                    <p>I still recommend the below walking and hiking website as I believe this is very beneficial to
                        shape your growth mindset. </p>
                    <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/nz/walking-and-hiking/?cid=p:sem:NZ:0721:inspire:always-on:google:kwd&kwid=kwd-356794582035&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIw6vq3_fZ8QIV8JFmAh3K5wQJEAAYASAAEgLBtfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">WALKING AND HIKING</a>
                    <p>I was quite surprised that neuroplasticity can physically change your brain and stimulate your
                        neuronal synapse growth and wire together. Furthermore it propagates through connecting more
                        neurons together. This makes your brain work faster and more active. The growth mindset is
                        basically a “can-do” attitude. This keeps reminding me that I can finish the assignments and I
                        can keep learning and growing in this and future learning journeys. </p>
