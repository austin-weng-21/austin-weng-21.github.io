                    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
                    <p>According to the University of New Hampshire psychology department, emotional intelligence is the
                        "ability to validly reason with emotions and to use emotions to enhance thought." EQ refers to
                        an individual's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions. People with high
                        EQ can manage emotions, use their emotions to facilitate thinking, understand emotional meanings
                        and accurately perceive others' emotions. EQ is partially determined by how a person relates to
                        others and maintains emotional control.</p>
                    <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
                    <p>Your IQ usually refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the most common elements of your IQ
                        include your ability to:</p>
                    <ul class="post-section-list">
                        <li> use logic to solve problems </li>
                        <li> plan and strategize</li>
                        <li> understand abstract ideas</li>
                        <li> learn and adapt to change</li>
                        <li> grasp and use language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in
                        other people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behavior. In general,
                        if you have a high EQ, you may find it easier to:</p>
                    <ul class="post-section-list">
                        <li> identify emotions in yourself and others </li>
                        <li> empathize with other people </li>
                        <li> adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations </li>
                        <li> control your impulses </li>
                        <li> withstand temptations and delay gratification </li>
                        <li> resolve conflicts with others </li>
                        <li> communicate effectively </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence is important, the value and benefits of developing your EQ are extensive
                        and in many areas massively under-utilised. Emotional intelligence is the gateway to living a
                        more fulfilled and happy life, and here’s why:</p>
                    <ul class="post-section-list">
                        <li>Emotional intelligence allows you to understand and manage your emotions in order to
                            self-motivate and to create positive social interactions; it’s the first step in realizing
                            your
                            true potential. </li>
                        <li> The value and benefits of EI are vast in terms of personal, academic, and professional
                            success. </li>
                        <li> Individuals with higher levels of emotional intelligence are less likely to succumb to the
                            negative impacts of stressors, while effectively help individuals deal with negative
                            emotions and promote more positive emotions in its place. </li>
                        <li> Intellect works best when it’s accompanied by high emotional intelligence. </li>
                        <li> Utilizing and developing emotional intelligence in the workplace can greatly improve both
                            job performance and the social capabilities of individuals within that workplace. </li>
                        <li> Emotional Intelligence is a useful skill to prevent making decisions based on emotional
                            biases. </li>
                        <li> The process of successful communication and negotiation are closely linked to high levels
                            of EQ.
