                <h4>Core Values</h4>
                <div class="justify">
                    <p>Integrity, humor, kindness, fairness, commitment, responsibility, consideration
                        for
                        others, courage, independence, pragmatism, reliability, respect, freedom. </p>
                    <p>There was one customer approached us to fix his bike that has been quoted for $1200 of repairing
                        cost
                        and he is happy to pay us $1000 if we could fix it. We took a careful check and found the issue
                        is
                        not that serious. The total bill for this repair job was only $90 ( the bike never comes back
                        for
                        this issue). I was reported by the workshop manager about this case and as a director I could
                        easily
                        instruct my workshop manager to take $800 since we have $1000 agreed budget. This is easy money
                        but
                        I will never allow this thing to happen as this is totally against my values. The customer
                        couldn’t
                        believe it when we told him the job only costs him $90 instead of $1000 and he was so touched
                        and said thank you
                        to
                        almost every person at my company. I always believe that it’s our responsibilty to build a
                        trustworthy society and keep it for our descendants. </p>
                    <p>I was born in China and the collectivism culture has deeply influenced me. I was educated to be
                        responsible for my families, helpful for my friends and considerate for others. </p>
                    <p>In terms of my strengths in learning, I’m a targeted-oriented, motivated person. Once I believe
                        the
                        knowledge is what I need I will be fully committed to it. I will devote myself to learn as much
                        as I
                        can spontaneously. My limitation might be biased learning. I tend to learn what I’m interested
                        and
                        what I believe is pragmatic. This limits my breadth of my knowledge. </p>
                    <p>When I was at university there was a study group that we had to team up to work on an assignment.
                        I
                        was quite opinionated then and insisted that my idea was the best idea. Without doubt, my other
                        study mates were not happy about the fact that I wasn’t listening to their opinions. I tried
                        very
                        hard to persuade them, sometimes, maybe with loud voice. This was not effective at all. I
                        learned
                        from this case and realised that no matter I agree or not agree with someone’s idea I should
                        always
                        respect them by listening to their opinions. If I still believe that I have the best idea I will
                        give
                        them time and gradually persuade them with supporting evidences. </p>
