                    <h4>Long Term Goal and Career Pathway</h4>
                    <p>
                        After learning the new IT skills from Dev Academy I will go back to my company and improve my
                        company’s IT system and websites. I found that learning IT does not only teach me how to code
                        but also how to think. The structure, logic, ways to make things work have already impressed me
                        with the idea how a good system works. I could utilize this newly gained skills to re-shape and
                        improve my whole company’s running system. As to my long term goal it stays the same. I would
                        like to understand how this IT world works and be able to communicate with these people who
                        shapes our future and become one of these people.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sames as I mentioned before on the foundation learning plan my strengths are self-motivation,
                        perseverance, proactive thinking and eager to learn pragmatic knowledge. My limitations are
                        knowledge breadth, family duties, company duties. Time is a very scarce resource. I have to
                        prioritize my life duties, family first, company second and then myself development. I just hope
                        that during my learning time at bootcamp my family and my company all go well and I can fully
                        focus on learning the new skills.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Non-Technical Challenge at Bootcamp </h4>
                    <p>
                        My biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp might be arriving at bootcamp on time everyday.
                        As I mentioned before I have my kids’ duty come first and plus the Auckland traffic is of no
                        help. Certainly, I will try my best to arrive before the scheduled time.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Human Skills</h4>
                    <p>
                        It’s still the same that I’d like to become more patient and open-minded with other people’s
                        ideas. Listening skill is what I need to develop.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Expectations From the Bootcamp Team</h4>
                    <p>
                        I believe EDA already has a very good supportive environment and friendly facilitators. I expect
                        when I have technical or non-technical issues the bootcamp facilitators can guide me through the
                        process and reach the best solutions.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Expectations of Myself on Bootcamp</h4>
                    <p>
                        I expect that I learn everything that is taught at the Bootcamp. I understand this could be stressful
                        and intensive. My determination will lead me through this process. If I encounter anything that
                        I don’t understand for the first time ,I will, as long as time allows, study it again the second
                        time, third time until I get it. I will seek for help from the internet, my peer learners and
                        facilitators if necessary. I understand how important a teamwork is and it’s always in my mind
                        that I should always treat others with respect and fairness.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="no-dec">Foundation Learning Plan</h4>
                    <p>My long term goal of learning IT is to understand how this IT world works and be able to
                        communicate with these people who shapes our future and become one of these people. </p>
                    <p>
                        My strengths of learning lies in being a self-motivated person with proactive thinking and eager
                        to
                        learn pragmatic knowledge. That’s why I took a break from my full time job and attended DEV
                        Academy
                        to prepare for my future. My limitation is that my knowledge breadth is limited as I’m only
                        interested in learning the knowledge that I believe is useful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regards to human skills I’d to like to become more patient and open-minded with other
                        people’s
                        ideas. Listening skill is what I need to develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I’m committed to this learning programme I will try my best to overcome any obstacle that I
                        may
                        encounter. I will search internet for help or seek for help from my facilitators and other
                        learners
                        if necessary. If things are building up and starting to get to me I will take a short break, do
                        some
                        physical exercise or go for a walk and keep telling myself that where there’s a will there’s a
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The facilitation team is supposed to help me out when I have problems with my learning. My
                        experience so far suggests that they are doing very good job guiding me through and helping me
                        out
                        with my questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two major commitments that I have besides learning are my kids and my company. I have
                        pre-arranged all the matters before I attended EDA. I do spend some time with my kids and take
                        care
                        some of my company stuff daily. So far I manage it well. However, if anything happens that
                        requires
                        me to be there and caused some block-out times I will try my best to make it up.
