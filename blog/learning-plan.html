                    <p>My long term goal of learning IT is to understand how this IT world works and be able to
                        communicate with these people who shapes our future and become one of these people. </p>
                    <p>
                        My strengths of learning lies in being a self-motivated person with proactive thinking and eager
                        to
                        learn pragmatic knowledge. That’s why I took a break from my full time job and attended DEV
                        Academy
                        to prepare for my future. My limitation is that my knowledge breadth is limited as I’m only
                        interested in learning the knowledge that I believe is useful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regards to human skills I’d to like to become more patient and open-minded with other
                        people’s
                        ideas. Listening skill is what I need to develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I’m commited to this learning programme I will try my best to overcome any obstacle that I
                        may
                        encounter. I will search internet for help or seek for help from my facilitators and other
                        learners
                        if necessary. If things are building up and starting to get to me I will take a short break, do
                        some
                        physical excercise or go for a walk and keep telling myself that where there’s a will there’s a
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The facilitation team is supposed to help me out when I have problems with my learning. My
                        experience so far suggests that they are doing very good job guiding me through and helping me
                        out
                        with my questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two major commitments that I have besides learning are my kids and my company. I have
                        pre-arranged all the matters before I attended EDA. I do spend some time with my kids and take
                        care
                        some of my company stuff daily. So far I manage it well. However, if anything happens that
                        requires
                        me to be there and caused some block-out times I will try my best to make it up.
