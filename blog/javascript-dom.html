                    <h4>Differences between HTML and CSS</h4>
                    <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the language which is used to define the
                        structure of a web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used to style web
                        documents, in other words, for styling. One of the good examples to explain the relation between
                        them may be a house. When you build a house it has all the frames, walls, ceilling and other
                        structural items all ready. Hoever it’s pretty plain if they have no colors and styles. That’s
                        where CSS comes to play. CSS paints the house, polishes the floor,decorate ceiling and makes the
                        house beautiful.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Control flow and loops </h4>
                    <p> Control flow in JavaScript is how your computer runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the
                        first line and ends at the last line, unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow
                        of the program such as loops, conditionals, or functions. Below is a daily life example for
                        this. In winter,every morning I drive my car and dop off my sons to school. The if statement
                        works well here. If
                        my car window is frosted then I need to use some warm water to wash it off otherwise I can drive
                        without doing this step. As to loops, every morning I remind my kids to bring their school bag,
                        lunch, water and loop through all the items they may need for the day before leaving for school.
                    </p>
                    <h4>DOM</h4>
                    <p> The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents and it is a platform and language-neutral
                        interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
                        structure, and style of a document." The way I interact with the Dom is through Javascript. We
                        can get hold of any element in the DOM to style, modify, move or delete it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>
                    <p> Both JavaScript arrays and objects are variables and they are used to store multiple values in a
                        single variable. The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects are one accesses
                        data through index number and the other one through property.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Functions</h4>
                    <p> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.A function allows
                        you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A
                        JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).Quite often we need to
                        perform a similar action in many places of the script. Functions allow the code to be called
                        many times and avoids repetitive codes and controls the workflow.
