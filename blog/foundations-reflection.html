                    <h4>Core Learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are three new things that I learned form the last five weeks core learning. The first and
                        most important one for me is the emotional intelligence. Although I thought I knew this EQ thing
                        very well but I never actually used it well until this IT learning journey. During the last
                        five weeks I came across a lot of problems such as totally new things to learn, balancing family
                        time and learning and my company stuff. It sounds easier than it actually is. Until now I
                        finally realize EQ plays such an important role in our life. The second thing that I learned is
                        that our neuro and brain can reshape physically. Before I thought that all learning were just
                        happening at our mental level. The third thing is the listening and looping. Fully listening and
                        no interruption actually gives me the full information of other people. This is really important
                        for teamworks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Values, Empathy and Self Awareness</h4>
                    <p>
                        Now we can say that we cannot live without programming. Itâ€™s everywhere in our life. All the
                        best programs are made by teamwork. A team of different ideas, visions, concerns, cultures,
                        dreams that all combine together to create something that is valuable to our society. No matter
                        what program that we are trying to create the most important thing that we need to bear in mind
                        is what positive impact we can bring to our society as a team player.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Surprise and challenge </h4>
                    <p>
                        I was surprised that a programming school put so much focus on core learning not full time
                        learning programming skills which I thought a programming school would do. The challenge is that
                        the core leaning and blog writing took so much time our programming skills may not be progressing
                        as expected.
                    </p>
                    <h4>EDA and Core Learning </h4>
                    <p>
                        EDA has been doing this core learning for a long time and I believe there must be a good reason
                        for it. Personally I think, well I might be wrong, the core learning should only account for
                        about 20% of the whole learning process. The main focus should always be on programming skills.
