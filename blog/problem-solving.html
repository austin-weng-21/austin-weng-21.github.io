                    <h4>Blocked on a simple problem</h4>
                    <p> The problem happened when I was doing the Super FizzBuzz programming exercise. It was required to
                        return the array with multiples of 3 replaced by Fizz, multiples of 5 replaced by Buzz and
                        multiples of 15 replaced by FizzBuzz. What happened was that I couldn’t get FizzBuzz even though
                        I checked any codes numerous times and still believed there was nothing that I did wrong. I just
                        couldn’t get the array required. It was really time-consuming and frustrating.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way </h4>
                    <p>Eventually I managed to find the bug in my codes and this is a mixed issue with math and coding.
                        Firstly, I was so focused on the codes itself and forgot sometimes this could be also a math issue. I
                        realized that in modulus whatever multiples of 15 are multiples of 3 and 5 too. Secondly I found
                        that the if statement will execute immediately once the conditions is met. Therefore, I hoisted
                        the if statement for multiples of 15 to the first place and the problem was solved. What I
                        learned from this case is that I shouldn’t only focus on the coding part and neglect the problem
                        itself. Sometimes the solution sits outside the codes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Problem solving techniques</h4>
                    <p> I tried all the problem solving techniques except writing pseudocode as I believe this doubles
                        the work and doesn’t work for me. The most important ones for me are reading error
                        message, console.logging, googling and trying something simpler. I don’t tend to ask my peers and
                        coaches until I tried everything and really couldn’t figure it out. The Rubber ducky method is
                        a very interesting way of problem solving but I tweaked it a bit to become more suitable for
                        myself. Instead of talking to an inanimate stuff I talk to myself the whole process. Reflection
                        is another really useful techniques. The good thing about reflection is that you don’t have to
                        sit in front of the computer, which you sometimes just had enough. Do it when you take for a
                        walk, have a shower or even lie in bed. Amazingly, sometimes the solution just clicks in. In
                        short, all the problem solving techniques work but some might be more effective and suitable
                        depending on the user.
